    QMVC - Reference Implementation of paper:

    SIGGRAPH Asia 2018
    
    This program allows to compute QMVC for a set of 3D points contained 
    in a cage made of quad and triangles, as well as other flavors of 
    space coordinates for cages (MVC, SMVC, GC, MEC). It comes also with 
    a 3D viewer which helps deforming a mesh with a cage.
